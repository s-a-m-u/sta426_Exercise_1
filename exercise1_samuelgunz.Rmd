### Samples form a log normal distribution

Generating 100 samples from a log normal distribution

```{r lognorm}
x <- rlnorm(100,1,0.25)
```

### Plot of the distribution


```{r hist}
hist(x)
```

### The plot of the distribution on the log scale
```{r loghist}
hist(log(x))
```

### Evaluating the mean and variance of our sample

```{r meanvar}
meanx <- mean(x)
varx <- var(x)

```

The mean of the sample is **`r meanx`**  and variance of the sample is **`r varx`**
